# simple-java-blockchain #
The intention of this project is to understand the basics of a blockchain and to practice java.

## General info ##

### What is a blockchain? ###

A blockchain is a chain of blocks. Every block contains the hash code of the previous block
and the data of the current block. To add a Block to the blockchain the new block with data 
and previous hash are getting hashed and then are appended to the existing chain.

### Intention of using Java ###
- object orientation comes handy for Blocks and Blockchain.
- practicing a new oop language with a python and C++ oop background
